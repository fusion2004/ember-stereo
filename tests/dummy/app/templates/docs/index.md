## History
This project started as [`ember-hifi`](http://github.com/nypublicradio/ember-hifi) in 2016, an open source audio library funded by New York Public Radio and built by [Jeff Keen](http://github.com/jkeen) and [Brian Whitton](http://github.com/noslouch). `ember-hifi` still powers most of NY Public Radio's web sites and is working great. But as of this writing most of NYPR's sites are still tied to ember classic, and I wanted to move past that. Over the past year or so I've been upgrading hifi, reducing the barrier to entry, and solving some longer-standing gotchas. Now the changes are big enough to warrant a fresh start. Ta-da! Stereo.
